title: "Delocalization Effect Promoted the Indoor Air Purification via Directly Unlocking the Ring-Opening Pathway of Toluene"

permalink: /publication/2020-06-29-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'The ring-opening process was generally considered as the rate-determining step for aromatic volatile organic compound photocatalytic degradation. A sophisticated and intensive degradation pathway is critical to the poor removal efficiency and low mineralization. In the present contribution, we successfully tailored and identified the ring-opening pathway of toluene elimination by electron delocalization in a borocarbonitride photocatalyst. By means of modulation of the dopant coordination configuration and electron geometry in the catalyst, the lone electrons of carbon transform into delocalized counterparts, sequentially elevating the interaction between the toluene molecules and photocatalyst. The aromatic ring of toluene can be attacked directly in the effect of electron delocalization without engendering additional intermediate species, significantly facilitating the removal and mineralization of toluene. This unprecedented route-control strategy alters the aromatic-ring-based reaction behavior from toluene to CO2 and paves a way to purify the refractory pollutants from the top design.'

The ring-opening process was generally considered as the rate-determining step for aromatic volatile organic compound photocatalytic degradation. A sophisticated and intensive degradation pathway is critical to the poor removal efficiency and low mineralization. In the present contribution, we successfully tailored and identified the ring-opening pathway of toluene elimination by electron delocalization in a borocarbonitride photocatalyst. By means of modulation of the dopant coordination configuration and electron geometry in the catalyst, the lone electrons of carbon transform into delocalized counterparts, sequentially elevating the interaction between the toluene molecules and photocatalyst. The aromatic ring of toluene can be attacked directly in the effect of electron delocalization without engendering additional intermediate species, significantly facilitating the removal and mineralization of toluene. This unprecedented route-control strategy alters the aromatic-ring-based reaction behavior from toluene to CO2 and paves a way to purify the refractory pollutants from the top design.
