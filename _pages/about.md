I am a third-year PhD student from [College of Sciences](https://scicol.shu.edu.cn/) , [Shanghai University](https://www.shu.edu.cn/). I'm now doing researches as a visiting phD in University of Toronto, supervised by [Prof. Geoffrey Ozin](http://nanowizard.info/). My research interests include the photo-assisted heterogeneous catalysis for the energy and environmental applications. 
Meanwhile, I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Dengsong Zhang](https://scicol.shu.edu.cn/info/1241/7550.htm) of International Joint Laboratory of Catalytic Chemistry, Shanghai University now.

You can find my CV here: [Wenqiang’s Curriculum Vitae](https://wenqiang2.github.io/cv/)

Skills
======
  1.Lab skills
  ---
  
  Based on the instruments in our research lab in Shanghai University, I developed lots of characterization skills and I can operate them independently:
  in-situ FTIR, in-situ Raman, in-situ XRD, ALD, SEM, AFM, GC-MS, TPD-MS, BET, UV-vis and etc.
  Here are some pictures of the charicterization process：

  2.Theoretical simulations skills
  ---
  
  I was also also familiar with the theoretical simulations, especially for the density functional theory (DFT) in the catalytic reactions. The electronic structure analysis and structure-activity relationship are particularly interested. At present, by operating the software of VASP and CP2K, I can carry out various calculations for the catalytic reactions, including the reaction processes (adsorption energy and transition states), electronic structure analysis (Bader charge analysis, differential charge density, projected density of state analysis, etc.) and ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD, time-dependent adsorption kinetics).
  
  Here are some pictures of the calculations by myself：
