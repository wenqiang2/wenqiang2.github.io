excerpt: "The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single-atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00×1010 N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M−H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.<br/><img src='/images/Publication/2023LMAngew.jpg'>"

The slow water dissociation process in alkaline electrolyte severely limits the kinetics of HER. The orientation of H2O is well known to affect the dissociation process, but H2O orientation is hard to control because of its random distribution. Herein, an atomically asymmetric local electric field was designed by IrRu dizygotic single-atom sites (IrRu DSACs) to tune the H2O adsorption configuration and orientation, thus optimizing its dissociation process. The electric field intensity of IrRu DSACs is over 4.00×1010 N/C. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with in situ Raman spectroscopy analysis on the adsorption behavior of H2O show that the M−H bond length (M=active site) is shortened at the interface due to the strong local electric field gradient and the optimized water orientation promotes the dissociation process of interfacial water. This work provides a new way to explore the role of single atomic sites in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction.
