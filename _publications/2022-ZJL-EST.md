title: "NOx Reduction over Smart Catalysts with Self-Created Targeted Antipoisoning Sites"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2022-05-02-paper-paper-number5
excerpt: "Selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the presence of alkali (earth) metals and heavy metals is still a challenge due to the easy deactivation of catalysts. Herein, NOx reduction over smart catalysts with self-created targeted antipoisoning sites is originally demonstrated. The smart catalyst consisted of TiO2 pillared montmorillonite with abundant cation exchange sites to anchor poisoning substances and active components to catalyze NOx into N2. It was not deactivated during the NOx reduction process in the presence of alkali (earth) metals and heavy metals. The enhanced surface acidity, reducible active species, and active chemisorbed oxygen species of the smart catalyst accounted for the remarkable NOx reduction efficiency. More importantly, the self-created targeted antipoisoning sites expressed specific anchoring effects on poisoning substances and protected the active components from poisoning. It was demonstrated that the tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum species of the smart catalyst mainly acted as self-created targeted antipoisoning sites to stabilize the poisoning substances into the interlayers of montmorillonite. This work paves a new way for efficient reduction of NOx from the complex flue gas in practical applications.<br/><img src='/images/Publication/2022ZJLEST.jpg'>"

Selective catalytic reduction of NOx in the presence of alkali (earth) metals and heavy metals is still a challenge due to the easy deactivation of catalysts.
