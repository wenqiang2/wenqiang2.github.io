excerpt: "Promoting the ring-opening process is vital to increase the mineralization of aromatic volatile organic compounds. Rational regulation of metal-support interaction is essential for the opening of the aromatic ring over Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Herein, the Pt/TiO2-C catalyst with Tiδ+-Vo·-Ptδ+ interface obtained by reverse electron transfer is successfully regulated via reduction–oxidation treatment for efficient photocatalytic degradation of toluene. This structure accelerates the pre-activation of toluene to generate abundant reactive intermediate species for the photocatalysis reaction. On the other hand, the special interface endows Pt/TiO2-C the ability to produce more reactive oxygen species under illumination, which can synergistically promote the direct opening of benzene ring. The Pt/TiO2-C shows a stronger oxidation capacity and a mineralization rate 15% higher than the traditional Pt/TiO2. This work proves that reduction–oxidation treatment is an effective approach to modify catalysts for air purification and provides a novel idea for the degradation of other aromatic volatile organic pollutants.<br/><img src='/images/Publication/2022WQCEJ.jpg'>"

Promoting the ring-opening process is vital to increase the mineralization of aromatic volatile organic compounds. Rational regulation of metal-support interaction is essential for the opening of the aromatic ring over Pt/TiO2 catalysts. Herein, the Pt/TiO2-C catalyst with Tiδ+-Vo·-Ptδ+ interface obtained by reverse electron transfer is successfully regulated via reduction–oxidation treatment for efficient photocatalytic degradation of toluene. This structure accelerates the pre-activation of toluene to generate abundant reactive intermediate species for the photocatalysis reaction. On the other hand, the special interface endows Pt/TiO2-C the ability to produce more reactive oxygen species under illumination, which can synergistically promote the direct opening of benzene ring. The Pt/TiO2-C shows a stronger oxidation capacity and a mineralization rate 15% higher than the traditional Pt/TiO2. This work proves that reduction–oxidation treatment is an effective approach to modify catalysts for air purification and provides a novel idea for the degradation of other aromatic volatile organic pollutants.
