title: "Ultrahighly Alkali-Tolerant NOx Reduction over Self-Adaptive CePO4/FePO4 Catalysts"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-09-11-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'Catalyst deactivation caused by alkali metal poisoning has long been a key bottleneck in the application of selective catalytic reduction of NOx with NH3 (NH3–SCR), limiting the service life of the catalyst and increasing the cost of environmental protection. Despite great efforts, continuous accumulation of alkali metal deposition makes the resistance capacity of 2 wt % K2O difficult to enhance via merely loading acid sites on the surface, resulting in rapid deactivation and frequent replacement of the NH3–SCR catalyst. To further improve the resistance of alkali metals, encapsulating alkali metals into the bulk phase could be a promising strategy. The bottleneck of 2 wt % K2O tolerance has been solved by virtue of ultrahigh potassium storage capacity in the amorphous FePO4 bulk phase. Amorphous FePO4 as a support of the NH3–SCR catalyst exhibited a self-adaptive alkali-tolerance mechanism, where potassium ions spontaneously migrated into the bulk phase of amorphous FePO4 and were anchored by PO43– with the generation of Fe2O3 at the NH3–SCR reaction temperature. This ingenious potassium storage mechanism could boost the K2O resistance capacity to 6 wt % while maintaining approximately 81% NOx conversion. Besides, amorphous FePO4 also exhibited excellent resistance to individual and coexistence of alkali (K2O and Na2O), alkali earth (CaO), and heavy metals (PbO and CdO), providing long durability for CePO4/FePO4 catalysts in flue gas with multipollutants. The cheap and accessible amorphous FePO4 paves the way for the development and implementation of poisoning-resistant NOx abatement.'
